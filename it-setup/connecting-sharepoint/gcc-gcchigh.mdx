## GCC Environment

1. Navigate to [<u>https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/</u>](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/)
2. Click on "Users" in the side panel
3. Click on "External access" under Users
4. Ensure that either "Allow all external domains", "Allow only specific external domains", or "Block only specific external domains" is selected. <Tooltip tip="">If "Block all external domains" is selected, GovEagle support will not be accessible via Microsoft Teams chat</Tooltip>
5. If necessary, add the following as an external domain: [<u>goveagle.onmicrosoft.com</u>](http://goveagle.onmicrosoft.com)
6. Try sending Gabe Villasana ([<u>gabe.villasana@goveagle.onmicrosoft.com</u>](mailto:gabe.villasana@goveagle.onmicrosoft.com)) a chat message on teams. If you are able to, you have setup the teams permissions properly

## GCCHigh Environment

For GCCHigh environments, the process differs due to enhanced security requirements:

1. Navigate to your GCCHigh admin portal at [<u>https://admin.teams.microsoft.us/</u>](https://admin.teams.microsoft.us/)
2. Follow similar steps as above, but note that external domain access may be more restricted
3. Contact your security administrator for GCCHigh-specific SharePoint integration requirements

<Note>
GCCHigh environments have additional security controls that may require special configuration. Please consult with your IT security team for compliance requirements.
